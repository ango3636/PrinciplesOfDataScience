## 5 Visualizations:

# Visual 1: Average score by Race/Ethnicity Group
    In this analysis, you can see what average scores each race/ethnicity got per subject.
    I feel this shows what level each group is at. In the bar chart, you can see group A's score
    performance averaged lower scores compared to other groups. Whilst, group E averaged the highest.
    This might make you wonder why is group A performing the worst?

# Visual 2: Score distributions
    In this analysis, you see three charts that visualize all scores for each subject in a histogram.
    This chart gives some more basic information and generalizes all scores without any other factors.
    You can see that many test takers got between 65-70 in math, 70-75 in reading, 65-75 in writing.
    This type of information could be good to come back to when comparing scores such as confirming
    group A's average math score was 60, which can be noted as below the average distribution.

# Visual 3: Scores by Test Preparation
    In this analysis, you see the scores per subject based on whether they completed the test preparation or not.
    With the use of box plots, you can see that for all subjects, those who completed the test prep had higher scores
    than those who didn't. This makes analysis easier for only the reason of determining if test preparation is important
    or not. You can see in the charts that the comparison for those who did test prep for math only performed slightly
    better. But those who did test prep had seemly significant enhanced performance compared to non-test-preppers.

# Visual 4: Average scores by Parent Level of Education
    In this analysis, you can where students who differ in scores by what level of education their parents received.
    You can see that average scores, for students with parents that had high school education, were lower than the
    rest. Average scores were highest for students whos parents received master degrees. Its quite interesting to see
    that students with parents who had some high school education had higher average scores than those with parents
    who finished their high school education. But overall, I think this analysis shows that when a parent has a higher 
    level of education, it could be concluded that a students score may average higher.

# Visual 5: Parent Level of Education per student by Race/Ethnicity Group
    In this analysis, you see the number of students per ethnicty group and what level of education some student's parents
    had Looking at the graph now, I can see how this might be a misleading graph. It might lead someone to think one 
    ethinicy group might have higher education than the other. But analyzing it, you can see, group C more simply
    has the highest number of individuals. Many individuals in that group had parents who recieved an associates degree. 
    This could make analysis easier though by seeing what group and what level of education these student's parents
    received were most prominent. You could correlate this chart and the first visualization and notice that group A has 
    lower average scores and the most prominent level of education was some high school.
